# ReviewsAnalysis_NLP

Analysis of the Restaurant reviews by using the Naive Bayes &amp; the Random Forests Algorithms and also validating the results using k-fold cross validation. 
The project steps involve the following...

● Importing the dataset

● Preprocessing the data

● Cleaning the data using 're' library

● Creating the bag of words model

● Splitting into Test & Train datasets

● Fitting Naive Bayes & the Random Forest classification models

● Finding the accuracy of the models using k-fold cross validation

By calculating the accuracies, we can clearly see that the Random Forest Algorithm performs better than the Naive Bayes Algorithm.
